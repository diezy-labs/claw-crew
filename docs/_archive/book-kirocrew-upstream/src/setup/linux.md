# Linux

Install, update, run as a service, and uninstall, all Linux distributions.

## Install

```sh
./install.sh
```

That is the whole install. Run it from a clone, or pipe it from `curl`:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

<!-- >>> generated:unix-fast-command by `cargo generate installers` - do not edit <<< -->
```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clawcrew-labs/clawcrew/master/install.sh | sh
```
<!-- >>> end generated:unix-fast-command <<< -->

</div>

The [canonical installation paths](../getting-started/quickstart.md#install) explain the fast and guided routes, source fallback, app selection, PATH handoff, and the next Quickstart step.

### Homebrew (Linuxbrew)

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
brew install clawcrew
```

</div>

Homebrew-on-Linux installs follow Homebrew's service path convention, your workspace lives under `$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/var/clawcrew/` instead of `~/.clawcrew/`. See [Service management](./service.md) for why this matters.

### NixOS

The upstream flake provides the ClawCrew CLI. With Nix and flakes enabled:

```sh
nix run github:clawcrew-labs/clawcrew -- --version
```

See [NixOS](./nixos.md) for source builds, the Nixpkgs package, and the
multi-instance NixOS service module. For prebuilt binaries, use the installer
described above.

## System dependencies

The core binary is statically linked where possible. Some features require system libraries:

| Feature | Package (Debian/Ubuntu) | Package (Arch) | Package (Fedora) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Docs translation (`cargo mdbook sync`) | `gettext` | `gettext` | `gettext` |
| Browser tool (playwright) | `libnss3`, `libatk1.0-0`, `libcups2` (see `playwright --help`) | `nss`, `atk`, `cups` | `nss`, `atk`, `cups` |
| Audio (TTS, voice channels) | `libasound2-dev` | `alsa-lib` | `alsa-lib-devel` |

The hardware feature (GPIO / I2C / SPI on a Pi) uses the pure-Rust `rppal` driver and needs no extra system library; it talks to `/dev/gpiomem`, `/dev/spidev*`, and `/dev/i2c-*` directly. What it does need is device access: enable the SPI/I2C interfaces and put the service user in the `gpio`, `spi`, and `i2c` groups (see [SBC / Raspberry Pi](#sbc--raspberry-pi) below).

Most deployments don't need any of these.

## Running as a service

Systemd is the default. OpenRC is detected and supported as a fallback.

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
clawcrew service install
clawcrew service start
clawcrew service status
```

</div>

Logs go to the systemd journal by default:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
journalctl --user -u clawcrew -f
```

</div>

Full details: [Service management](./service.md).

### SBC / Raspberry Pi

On a Raspberry Pi or similar SBC, build with the hardware feature:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
./install.sh --source --features hardware
```

</div>

For hardware access without running as root, the service user needs the `gpio`, `spi`, and `i2c` groups. The user-level unit that `clawcrew service install` writes does not set these; use the system-level Pi unit template at [`scripts/clawcrew.service`](https://github.com/clawcrew-labs/clawcrew/blob/master/scripts/clawcrew.service), which includes `SupplementaryGroups=gpio spi i2c`. Either way, verify your user is in those groups:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
getent group gpio spi i2c
sudo usermod -aG gpio,spi,i2c $USER
# re-login for group changes to take effect
```

</div>

## Update

Re-run the installer, it detects the existing install and upgrades in place:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clawcrew-labs/clawcrew/master/install.sh | sh -s -- --skip-quickstart
```

</div>

Or from a clone:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
cd /path/to/clawcrew
git pull
./install.sh --skip-quickstart
```

</div>

If installed via Homebrew instead:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
brew update && brew upgrade clawcrew
```

</div>

After updating, restart the service:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
clawcrew service restart
```

</div>

## Uninstall

If you installed with the bootstrap script, use the same script to uninstall:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
./install.sh --uninstall
```

</div>

Stop and remove the service:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
clawcrew service stop
clawcrew service uninstall
```

</div>

Remove the binary:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
# cargo install / bootstrap
rm ~/.cargo/bin/clawcrew

# Homebrew
brew uninstall clawcrew
```

</div>

Remove config and workspace (optional: this deletes conversation history):

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
rm -rf ~/.clawcrew ~/.config/clawcrew
```

</div>
